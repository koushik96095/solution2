			Sushi recipe tips:
			Can you keep sushi overnight? I don’t recommend this, as the longer you keep the raw fish, you risk bacteria growth and illness. If I find that we’re getting full and we still have ingredients left, we’ll usually just enjoy the rest of the fish, thinly sliced sashimi-style, because that’s the most valuable part, and let the rest of the ingredients go. Also, refrigerated rice gets hard and dry, and doesn’t reheat well, so sushi is something that should be eaten freshly made.
			Can you make sushi without fish? Yes, you can do vegetarian and even vegan sushi recipes. There are tons of ideas online, but avocado, cucumbers, and carrots are great filler ingredients.
			Easy rice cooker sushi rice: Sushi rice is an art that chefs spend years perfecting, but if you’re looking for something easy, I have a post on how to make sushi rice in the rice cooker.
			Enjoy!
			Place the seaweed on a bamboo mat, then cover the sheet of seaweed with an even layer of prepared sushi rice. Smooth gently with the rice paddle.
			Layer salmon, cream cheese, and avocado on the rice, and roll it up tightly. Slice with a sharp knife, and enjoy with soy sauce.
